//             <ul>
//               <li>For the second year in a row, resisting arrest/escape is the most common reason
// for force at 50.4%, followed by refusing verbal commands at 18%.</li>
//               <li>The other category decreased notably from 18.9% in 2017 to 6.4% in 2018.</li>
//               <li>Upon reviewing UOF statistics information from other police departments, it
// remains unclear as to whether “refusing verbal commands” is a justifiable reason
// for UOF. It is unclear from the data whether “refusing verbal commands"
// solely was the reason for the use of force or if verbal commands were part of a
// continuum and other incidents occurred that justified the force.</li>
//               <li>Some other departments also take into consideration whether a subject is
// exhibiting possible signs of mental illness in deciding if UOF is appropriate or
// justified.</li>
//             </ul>
//             <strong>In response to the last bullet point by OIPM above the NOPD sent the following
// response:</strong>
//             <p>NOPD policy 1.3: Use of Force states that “When feasible based on the circumstances,
// officers will use de-escalation techniques, disengagement; area containment;
// surveillance; waiting out a subject; summoning reinforcements; and/or calling in
// specialized units such as mental health and crisis resources, in order to reduce the need
// for force, and increase officer and civilian safety. Moreover, the officers shall de-escalate
// the amount of force used as the resistance decreases.”</p>
//             <p>The use of force principles enshrined in policy 1.3: Use of Force include the following:
// “Officers will use disengagement; area containment; surveillance; waiting out a subject;
// summoning reinforcements; and/or calling in specialized units such as mental health
// professionals or a crisis response team, when feasible, in order to reduce the need for
// force and increase officer and civilian safety. (e) When possible, officers shall allow
// individuals time to submit to arrest.”</p>
//             <p>Police 1.3: Use of Force also specifically names “the subject’s mental state or capacity”
// as one of the “facts and circumstances” to consider “when determining whether to use
// force and in evaluating whether an officer has used reasonable force.”</p>
//             <p>All NOPD officers have received a minimum of eight hours of training on responding
// to persons in behavioral or mental crisis, as well as annual refresher instruction on crisis
// intervention and de-escalation tactics during Core In-Service.</p>
//             <p>NOPD has adopted the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) model, a nationally recognized
// ‘best practices’ approach in recognizing and managing behavior that may be
// attributable to a mental health disorder. Under this program, specially chosen officers
// receive 40 hours of intense training from mental health experts focused on techniques
// and best practices for minimizing the use of force against individuals in crisis due to
// mental illness or a behavioral disorder. CIT officers are assigned to each police district
// and are trained to respond to and de-escalate mental health crises. As of May 2019,
// NOPD has trained and certified 263 officers and supervisors. CIT-trained officers
// currently account for 38% of all patrol officers</p>

//             <strong><u>Recommendation</u></strong>
//             <p>OIPM recommends that NOPD clarify what the category “refusing verbal commands”
// means. It is unclear from the data whether “refusing verbal commands“solely was the
// reason for the use of force or if verbal commands were part of a continuum and other
// incidents occurred that justified the force.</p>

//               <li>The top three reasons for exhibiting firearms are flight from an officer, tactical
// deployments, and resisting lawful arrest.</li>
//               <li>Other represented about 10% of the reason for exhibiting a firearm, down from
// 30% in 2017 and over 50% in 2016. We commend NOPD for following our
